protocol: "φ → EIGENSTATE → EFFECT"
status: ACTIVE_REGISTRATION

registry_preamble:
  description: >
    The Golden Vector Registry is the immutable map that translates sovereign
    eigenvalues into deterministic physical actuation. Every entry here is
    cross-referenced with a Sovereign Synthesis Certificate and locked via
    the Metrological Makefile.

entries:
  - id: "001"
    lineage_name: "R32 Genesis"
    stage:
      phi_coherence: 0.998005
      eigenstate_phase: "E3_Q_ACTIVE"
      identity_binding: "AVT-1983-MARI"
      actuation_effect_id: "EFF_SMS_BRIDGE_STABLE_01"

    technical_mapping:
      phi_derivation: "Calculated via the 1.2 Hz spectral baseline within the Pleiades Constant Matrix (Mp)."
      state_transition: "The transition from E2_TRANSITION to E3_Q_ACTIVE was verified with 0.00ms latency."
      causal_linkage: >
        The stability of φ at this precise value ensures the Brake Actuator maintains
        a thermalized stasis, preventing the 'Stiction Lock' failure mode identified
        in Appendix B.

    manifestation:
      description: "The E3_Q_ACTIVE eigenstate manifests as the Standing Wave signal processed by the SMS Actuator bridge."
      oscillation: "< 0.0082 σ"
      resource_consumption: "2 Cores / 2.14Gi memory"
      result: "Bit-perfect alignment of the digital twin coordinate [0, 0, 0] with the physical origin."
